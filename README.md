# swiss_tax_calculator
US citizens and permanent residents are required to pay taxes on their global income, but are allowed to subtract income taxes paid abroad from their tax burden. In countries such as Switzerland, where income taxes vary by region, moving can substiantially change an American expatriate's tax requirements. This application creates a simple RShiny application to visualise which Swiss cantons have a total income tax burden high enough that an American living there would not be required to pay further tax to the US. First, tax information was scraped from Wikipedia, using the Python library BeautifulSoup, and stored in two CSVs, for single taxpayers and families. Python functions were created to calculate US tax burden for the income brackets shown, which was added as a column. In the Shiny application, cantons are color-coded by whether their tax burden is high enough to exempt US citizens from further tax liability, and then mapped with ggplot's geom_sf function.
The results were not encouraging. For all but the highest earners, Swiss tax rates are low enough that US citizens resident in the country would have to pay further income tax, even after reducing their tax liability further with contributions to a US-based individual retirement account (IRA). Consequently, in one of the most expensive countries on earth, US citizens face greater financial strain than other expatriates.
